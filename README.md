MathThroughCode
===============

A project to teach math &amp; science through javascript, rather than traditional symbol notation, via the web browser.

Each of the sections below should have games, and a look at the mathematical notation, and the algorithm notation

- Elementary (Level 1)
  - Add
  - Subtract
- Level 2
  - Multiply
  - Divide
  - Square
  - Cube
- Level 3
  - Power
  - Square Route
- College / Advanced Track

Having learnt to code in Basic (in the 90's as a child), I found mathematical concepts much easier to grasp by thinking of them proceduraly. I hope that this is true for more people than just myself.

If you are interested in contributing, please get in touch or create a pull request. I hope this will become an interactive game. Freely available to all.
